        <h2>phytochemical analysis of different commercial teabags</h2>
        <p>
            so many studies have shown that tea has health benefits associated with obesity, cancer and cardiovascular diseases and neurological diseases which are world leading trends of diseases. Research have shown that phytochemicals present in tea is the bedrock of tea's health benefits which have been suggested to function through multifunctional target, antioxidant property, metal chelating as well as inhibition activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this present study, the level of the presence of these phytochemicals(alkaloids, tannings, flavonoids, glycosides, cyanogenic glycosides and lignin) are compared in six different commercial teabags(Loyd, Top tea, Lipton, Dilma, Freshpark and Five Roses) using preliminary phytochemical screening method and statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA at alpha(P &lt 0.05) level of significance and pearson correlation(R)(*. Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level(2-tailed). And **. Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level(2-tailed)).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in conclusion all the different teabags label are positively inter-related though the strength of their relationship differs with one another. However, there is difference in the level of the presence of phytochemicals present among the teabags with Loyd having the highest level of tannings and cyanogenic glycosides, Loyd, Freshpark, and Five Roses has the highest level of alkaloids, Top tea has the highest level of flavonoids, Freshpark has the highest level of glycosides, and Lipton having the highest level of lignin, Loyd subsequently having  the highest level of total phytochemicals
